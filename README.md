This project implements the Polygon class on the basis of a linked list that maintains the list of vertices of the polygon by the order in which they appear in the polygon.
It does not matter who the first vertex is. Each vertex is represented by a point in the plane. As required in the course.

The project was written as part of the course "Introduction to Computer Science in JAVA" in my degree (Computer Science at the Open University).
